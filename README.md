## 📝 Introduction

> This Excel-based dashboard visualizes and analyzes gene expression data in relation to cancer presence. It enables medical researchers and data analysts to understand gene behavior across patient groups and explore patterns linked to cancer diagnosis.

---

## 🎯 Case Study

This dashboard is useful for clinical researchers and biomedical analysts to:

- Examine gene expression levels for cancer-positive and cancer-negative patients  
- Visualize correlations between different gene expressions  
- Analyze patient distribution based on expression levels  
- Identify gene markers that may contribute to cancer diagnosis

---

## 📊 Key Metrics

- 🔬 **Average Expression of Gene One**:  
  - Cancer Absent: 6.61  
  - Cancer Present: 4.60  
- 🧪 **Average Expression of Gene Two**:  
  - Cancer Absent: 6.60  
  - Cancer Present: 4.21  
- 👥 **Patient Distribution**:  
  - Expression Range [20, 360]: 6 patients  
  - Expression Range [360, 700]: 3 patients

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **Gene One and Gene Two** both show **higher expression** in cancer-negative patients compared to cancer-positive patients.  
2. There is a visible **positive correlation** between Gene One and Gene Two in scatter plot distribution.  
3. Most patients fall into the **lower expression range** (20 to 360), which may be linked to cancer status.  
4. Filters allow exploration by **expression ranges**, **gene combinations**, and **cancer presence**, making the dashboard highly interactive.  
5. The data suggests potential **biomarkers** for early detection or research into cancer-related gene expression.

---

## ⚙️ Process

1. Imported gene expression dataset into Excel  
2. Transformed and cleaned data using **Power Query**  
3. Built interactive visuals (bar, scatter, slicers)  
4. Applied filters and conditional formatting  
5. Designed dashboard layout for clarity and user interaction
